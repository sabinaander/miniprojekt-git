The goal is to create a web application with functionality to add to-dos to a calendar/planner.

The application is fully responsive, accurately tells the time and allows for adding to-dos regardless of your current year.

We have included several features in the project, such as a background image and welcome message that change depending on what time it is and which season of the year you are currently in. It is also possible to add, edit and remove to-dos which are stored in Local Storage. 
Your already created to-dos will be indicated by a badge in the calendar section of the application.
